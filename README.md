# How can i run it?
First download and compile Java from https://www.java.com/, or just install the .exe from the website if you are using Windows.
If your OS is Linux, you can use the package manager of your system, for exemple on Arch Linux with  ``` $ sudo pacman -S jre-openjdk-headless jre-openjdk jdk-openjdk openjdk-doc openjdk-src  ```

Then clone the repo with git: 
```ShellScript
git clone http://github.com/jiom-0/jsimple_binary_trees.git 
```
Or just download, decompress and follow the next steps:

### Windows
Decompress the files, go to the project folder then:
```BashScript
  
```

### Linux
Decompress the files, go to the project folder then:
For exemple:

```ShellScript

```

Binary tree and AVL are one of the simplest nonlinear algorithms in
data structures and become more interesting as the language becomes
more complex, especially Java, since almost everything must be stated
explicitly and without assumptions.

Here you can see that it is necessary to use things like generic classes 
and encapsulation different from other languages like python that make
the use of casting automatically.

Just for academic purpose.

You can consult the book Cormen-2002 used as a source.
