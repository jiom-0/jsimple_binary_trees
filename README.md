# How can i download?
First download and compile Java from https://www.java.com/, or just install the .exe from the website if you are using Windows.
If your OS is Linux, you can use the package manager of your system, for exemple:
#### pacman:
```
sudo pacman -S jre-openjdk-headless jre-openjdk jdk-openjdk openjdk-doc openjdk-src
```
#### apt:
```
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
```

Then clone the repo with git: 
```ShellScript
git clone http://github.com/jiom-0/jsimple_binary_trees.git 
```

Or just download, decompress and go to the project folder. Now you can do your changes.

For beginners we recommend the use and IDE like VScode to edit and execute the code.

Binary tree and AVL are one of the simplest nonlinear algorithms in
data structures and become more interesting as the language becomes
more complex, especially Java, since almost everything must be stated
explicitly and without assumptions.

Here you can see that it is necessary to use things like generic classes 
and encapsulation different from other languages like python that make
the use of casting automatically.

Just for academic purpose.

You can consult the book Cormen-2002 used as a source.
