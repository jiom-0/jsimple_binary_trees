# How can i run it?

Binary tree and AVL are one of the simplest nonlinear algorithms in
data structures and become more interesting as the language becomes
more complex, especially Java, since almost everything must be stated
explicitly and without assumptions.

Here you can see that it is necessary to use things like generic classes 
and encapsulation different from other languages like python that make
the use of casting automatically.

Just for academic purpose.
